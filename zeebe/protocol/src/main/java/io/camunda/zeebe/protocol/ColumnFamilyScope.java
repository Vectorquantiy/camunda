/**
 * Identifies whether a Column Family contains data that must be available on all partitions or just
 * on one.
 *
 * <p>As a rule of thumb, if a Column Family contains:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>process definitions, decisions definitions, forms definitions or identity entities they
 *       should be GLOBAL.
 *   <li>an instance of any kind, e.g. process instance, variables ecc, then it's likely that it's a
 *       PARTITION_LOCAL Column Family.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that a Column Family should not contain both: if that is the case, then the Column Family
 * should be split in two.
 *
 * <p>This information is crucial to be able to correctly bootstrap a new partition based on the
 * state of another partition.
