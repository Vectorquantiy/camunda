# Acceptance tests

This module contains acceptance tests (ATs), testing a complete user journey or a feature end-to-end (E2E), covering multiple or even all components at the same time in an integrated manner.
Details, general recommendations, and how-tos/examples of how to write them, you can find in the [acceptance test guide](/docs/testing/acceptance.md).
